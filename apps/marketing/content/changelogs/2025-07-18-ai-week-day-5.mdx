As we wrap up our first AI Week, we have two more (smaller) announcements to make.

## New Home

Firstly, our new homepage — simpler, less flashy, and with an interactive playground in the hero. So visitors can get a feel of how Firebuzz works without even logging in.

Check it out: [firebuzz.com/home](https://firebuzz.com/home)

## Launch Week Template

Secondly, we're open sourcing our AI Week Template, so you can use it in your next launch week! It's a beautiful little site, simple and neat, with a couple of details that make it shine:

- Countdown
- Newsletter
- All managed from Firebuzz

The template includes everything you need to create a compelling launch week experience, complete with daily announcements and community engagement features.
